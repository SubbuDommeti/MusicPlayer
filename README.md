Hello Everyone! Greetings of the Day

I would like to provide a brief overview of the MusicPlayer application.

Developed using Java in the Android Studio environment, the MusicPlayer application offers essential functions such as displaying a music list after obtaining storage permissions. Users can easily select songs to listen to and enjoy features like pause, play, next, previous, forward, and backward controls.

Additionally, the application allows users to conveniently adjust the playback position by dragging the music play line. To enhance the experience, a subtle animation engages users when a song is paused.

Thank you for your attention.
