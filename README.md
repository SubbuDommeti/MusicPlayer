Hello Everyone! Greetings of the Day

I would like to share some small details about the MusicPlayer application.

This was developed in Java using Android Studio. It consists of basic functions such as Displaying the music list after accepting the storage permissions and allowing us to select the song to listen to. And simultaneously, we can pause, play, next, previous, forward, and backward.

We can also drag the music play line to adjust the song to where we want to listen. There is also a little animation provided to engage the song's utility. This will come into play when we pause the song.
