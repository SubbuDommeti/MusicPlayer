Hello Everyone !! 
Greetings of the Day.

I would like to share some small details about the MusicPlayer  application.

This is developed with Java using Android Studio. It consists of basic functions as Displaying the music list after accepting the storage permissions and allow us to select the song  to listen. And simultaneously we can pause , play , next , Prev , forward and backward it.


We can also drag the music play line to adjust the song from where we want to listen. There is a little animation also provided to engage the song utility. This will come in to picture when we pause the song.
